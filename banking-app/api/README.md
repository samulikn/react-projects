# Bank API

> Bank API builted with Node.js + Express.

## Running the server on port 500

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Git clone this repo [React projects](https://github.com/samulikn/react-projects).
2. Open your terminal and navigate into the 'REACT-PROJECTS/banking-app/api' folder.
3. Run 'npm install' and wait for the packages to be installed(could take a while depending on the quality of your internet connection).
4. When the installation is over, run 'npm start' and you are good to go.

The server should start listening on port 5000. This server will be running together with the main bank app server terminal(listening on port 3000), do not close it.

> Note: all entries are stored in-memory and are not persisted, so when the server is stopped all data is lost.
