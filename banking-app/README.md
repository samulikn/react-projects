# Running the app

First make sure you have to run [API](/banking-app/api/README.md) server.

Any web server can be used to run the app, but since you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed anyway to run the API, you can:

1. Git clone repo [React projects](https://github.com/samulikn/react-projects).
2. Open a terminal, navigate to directory 'banking-app', then run 'npm start'. It will start a development web server on port 3000.
3. Open 'http://localhost:3000' in a browser to run the app.
